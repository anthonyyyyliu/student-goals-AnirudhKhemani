Goal 2: To increase my participation and grow my contribution to the class this year, I aim to post on Piazza whenever applicable. To make this more measurable, I will post at least once a unit. Further, my post should be a valid question, help me, and help another person.


Rubric:
- 4: I posted on Piazza 100% of the time and my posts were always valid questions. They helped me better understand something. I can confirm with another classmate that my post helped them.


- 3: I posted on Piazza over 60% of the time and my posts were always valid questions. They helped me better understand something. I can confirm with another classmate that my post helped them.

- 2: I posted on Piazza 30-60% of the time and my posts were always valid and helpful questions.

- 1: I posted on Piazza less than 30% of the time and/or my posts were usually unhelpful or invalid questions.
