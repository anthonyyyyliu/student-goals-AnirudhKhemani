Goal 1: Through this school year I aim to better manage my time and spread out my work. In order to implement this, I will complete the portion of assigned Practice-it problems pertinent to any given week's lessons by the following week. Additionally, I would like to have any questions I have on that week's lessons answered by the following week.

Goal 2: To increase my participation and grow my contribution to the class this year, I aim to post on Piazza whenever applicable. To make this more measurable, I will post at least once a unit. Further, my post should be a valid question, help me, and help another person.
